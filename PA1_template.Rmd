This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
act <- read.csv("activity.csv")
act$date<-as.Date(act$date)
daymean<-rowsum(act$step,act$date, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(date, daymean[,1], type = "l", main = 'Mean value of steps for each day', xlab = "date", ylab = "mean")

r<-rowsum(act$step, act$date, na.rm = TRUE)
mean<-mean(r)
median(r)
hist(r, col = "red", breaks = 35, xlab = "Day steps", main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day" )

act$step[is.na(act$step)] <- mean

fivemin<- rowsum(act$step, act$interval, na.rm = TRUE)
fivemin<-fivemin/length(int)
int<-unique(act$interval)
fivemean<- data.frame(fivemin[,1],int)
names(fivemean)<- c("mean","interval")
plot(int, fivemin,  xlab = "interval", ylab = "mean", type = "l")
fivemean[which(fivemean[,1]>37),]

weekend <- which(weekdays(act$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(act$date) == "Sunday")

weekday <- which(weekdays(act$date) == "Monday" | weekdays(act$date) == "Tuesday"| weekdays(act$date) == "Wednesday"| weekdays(act$date) == "Thursday"| weekdays(act$date) == "Friday")

actweekend <- act[weekend,]
actweekday <- act[weekday,]

fminwe<- rowsum(actweekend$steps, actweekend$interval, na.rm = TRUE)
fminwe <-fminwe/length(fminwe)
fminwd<- rowsum(actweekday$steps, actweekday$interval, na.rm = TRUE)
fminwd <-fminwd/length(fminwd)

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(unique(act$interval), fminwe, type = "l", xlab = "interval", ylab = "Number of steps", col = "sky blue", main = "Weekends")
plot(unique(act$interval), fminwd, type = "l", xlab = "interval", ylab = "Number of steps", col = "sky blue", main = "Weekdays")


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
